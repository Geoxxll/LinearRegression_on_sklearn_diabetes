# Linear Regression with PyTorch (Diabetes Dataset)

This project implements Linear Regression using PyTorch:

- Train/validation/test split
- Batch gradient descent with SGD
- Evaluation metrics: MSE, RMSE, RÂ²
- Visualization of training loss curve and predictions scatter plot

## Run

```bash
python src/train_torch.py
```
